# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

In addition to the general standards outlined above, we expect all contributors to adhere to the following rules based on .NET Core development practices:

- Write clean, maintainable code following the [Microsoft .NET Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).
- Follow the SOLID design patterns when architecting and implementing your thoughts.
- Document code thoroughly using XML documentation comments.
- Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- Use appropriate .NET Core libraries for specific tasks, following best practices and industry standards.
- Respect intellectual property rights and licenses of third-party libraries or frameworks used in the project.
- Strive for backward compatibility and avoid breaking changes whenever possible.
- Engage in constructive discussions and provide helpful feedback to fellow contributors.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [contact email]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
2. **Warning**: Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
3. **Temporary Ban**: Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
